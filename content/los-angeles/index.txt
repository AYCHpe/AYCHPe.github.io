about: The internet is at a crossroads. We’re dependent on it for staying in touch with our friends, accessing our memories, and enabling our livelihoods.

However, the tools we often use are built around centralized platforms, designed to capture and sell our attention.

What are the alternatives, and how do we use them today? This was an afternoon of relaxed conversation on using the peer-to-peer web, both within our practices and daily lives.

Held at [Los Angeles Contemporary Archive](http://lacarchive.com/) on December 10th, 2017. Thanks to [Jon](https://jongacnik.com), [Tara](https://taravancil.com/), [Paul](https://pfrazee.hashbase.io/), [Max](https://maxogden.com/), and everyone else involved.
