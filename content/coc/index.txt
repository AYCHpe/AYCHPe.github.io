## Harassment
Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Inappropriate and discriminatory verbal comments
- Intimidation and stalking
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Unwanted photographing or video/audio recordings

Anyone that is asked to stop harassing another participant is expected to comply immediately.

Participants, including speakers and organizers, found to be violating our Code of Conduct may be expelled from the event, and any future events held by Peer-to-Peer Web.
